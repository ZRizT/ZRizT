**Building systems intentionally.  Learning openly.  Creating with depth.**

I'm a student of Informatics Engineering exploring software architecture, secure systems, and the creative side of engineering. Welcome to my corner of GitHub.

## 👋 About

I believe the best engineers are curious, humble, and committed to understanding *why* things work—not just *that* they work. 

Right now, I'm: 
- **Learning:** System design, secure coding practices, and how to think like a builder
- **Building:** Tools and projects that teach me something new
- **Experimenting:** With game dev, AI, and the intersection of code and creativity
- **Growing:** One mistake at a time, learning from each one

I'm not a senior engineer. I'm not an expert. I'm a student who's decided to learn in public, build openly, and share the journey.  That honesty matters to me.

## 🎯 Vision:  Zora Studio

Zora Studio isn't a company.  It's my personal vision for a creative-technical practice. 

Think of it as a studio where:
- Software, games, tools, and experimental work coexist
- Ideas develop slowly and deliberately
- Quality and intention matter more than speed
- Learning and building are the same process

Every project here is part of that longer story. Some will become something meaningful. Others will be stepping stones.  All of them are valuable.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:**
- Python (main focus, everyday tool)
- C++ (systems thinking, deep learning)
- Kotlin (mobile exploration)
- C# (game development interest)

**Tools & Environment:**
- VS Code, Git & GitHub (daily workflow)
- Linux-based development
- Wireshark, Kali Linux, Burp Suite (security fundamentals)

**What this means:** I use these tools to learn, build, and solve problems. I'm competent with them, still growing in them, and honest about what I don't know yet.
